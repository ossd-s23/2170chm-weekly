title: Week 7 Project MindsDB Group
---
Our group was formed because we chose to work on the projects MindsDB and Teammates. So far, we have decided to focus on MindsDB and have planned our next meeting. We selected this project after researching different projects during class, looking for ones that we shared interests in and examining their issue pages to see if the community was active and there were enough issues to work on. We also checked if we could understand the issues and if they were within our ability level. After careful discussion, we chose MindsDB because there were active issues reported each week and a variety of documentation and programming issues that we felt comfortable tackling. <!--more-->Our goal is to start with simple contributions and eventually make significant contributions to the programming part of the project. I have confidence in my group members and believe that we can work well together to find and solve issues. However, I'm concerned that the project's structure might be complicated and require techniques that we are not familiar with, which could hinder our ability to make programming contributions.
