#### The Open Source Discussion
On Wednesday, we talked about the application of the idea of open source in different areas. One thing I learned is that we always had misconceptions about open-source projects, thinking that they would not have good qualities due to their inability to make a profit. However, there are many ways to build business models around open source, and the nature of open source can greatly improve the quality of projects. <!--more-->Many projects, like Blender, are used by many people without knowing that it is open source. I think it would be great if we actively look for ideas in different applications that we use so that we can make suggestions or contribute to them as we are the users and know where they can improve.
#### MindsDB Project
We have implemented the connection functions. In another application's handler, we learned how to pass in the credentials as we create a database instance, but our method of connection is different since it is provided by Google, and it can only process credentials in a JSON file. Therefore, instead of using the credentials directly, we automatically save them in a JSON file and create the connection with it. We will be finishing the feature of saving the data in MindsDB in the form of a Pandas Dataframe before the presentation.
